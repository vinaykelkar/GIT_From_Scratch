How to Link Local Project to GITHUB repo

1. git remote https://github.com/vinaykelkar/Learning_Git.git

Imagine you need to know which git repo URL is linked to your local repo

2. git remote -v

Now we need to push these changes to our URL/online repo

3. git push origin <branch_name>
git push origin master

NOTE: It is possible that you will be asked username and password for the first time you push the repo in github.com 

You can do following 

a. Enable credentials storage in your git repo
git config credential.helper store

b. Enable credentials storage globally 
git config credential.helper store
